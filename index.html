                            <p class="card-text">My name is Cliff Horvick. I am starting a new career as a web
                                developer.
                                I presently work in the consumer finance and mortgage business and have for the past
                                twenty

                                years.
                                My experience in sales, underwriting, funding, servicing, collection and portfolio
                                management
                                for profitability is extensive. I have supervised and trained many successful teams and
                                from
                                2004 until 2012
                                was a Reigional Manager for a major financial organization in the Philadelphia area. I
                                supervised up
                                to ten full service offices at once and had staff of over sixty people reporting
                                directly to
                                me
                                and/or my direct reports. As I complete my education as a web developer I will draw from
                                my
                                experience and skills learned from my present occupation. As someone with a strong

                                expectations
                                in the age of mobile devices and knowing all aspects of what financial organizations
                                must
                                do for compliance and security behind the scenes I will be a web designer who will truly
                                understand
                                the needs of my clients and employers.
